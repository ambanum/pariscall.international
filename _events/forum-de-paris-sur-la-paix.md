As the crisis of the international system worsens, global cooperation is slowing with states competing
and expanding military expenditures. International norms and human rights are disregarded, questioning
international justice. Globalization lacks regulation, the Internet is dominated by abusive
corporations, propagandists and hackers, and the race against global warming carries on.\\
The Paris Peace Forum was created to counter these tendencies and to convene all those among States and
civil society that believe in collective action, multilateralism and the good stewardship of common
public goods to address common challenges and maintain peace.
